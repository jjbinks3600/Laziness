    <p class="header3">How do I open the .SWF files?</p>
    <p>
      I am currently working on a way for the chromebooks to open them, but as
      for the PCs, I have a sort of solution:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Navigate to the file you want to open in the google drive, and then
        double click on it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, download the file, and figure out where it downloaded to, and open
        the file explorer thingy and set it up somewhere.
      </li>
      <li>
        After, press the windows key, right by the alt key, and then type “VLC”.
        click on the little traffic cone. This requires you to previously
        download the, well, ”VLC player” from the applications section of the
        download page. In the VLC player, open the file that you downloaded, or
        just drag and drop the file from your downloads folder to your player
      </li>
    </ol>

  <p>Not much information right now... sorry...</p>
