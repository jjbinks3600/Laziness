    <p class="header3">
      Thats why we have games. We have games all over the internet.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="header3">
      And we also have friends. <br />
      Friends that take multiple hours of their own time just to chat with us.
      Just to spend time with us. We have friends that, no matter the
      circumstances, will <b>always</b> be there for you in order to help you if
      you need it. <br />
      We have friends that will go through heaven and hell to make you feel
      happier. They will do <b>anything</b> for you. No matter how bad of a day
      they might be having.<br /><br />
      Some of us even have friends that will do anything to acheive a goal of
      theirs. They will spend countless hours of their life scouring the
      internet for any kind of site that you can play games on.<br />
      I have done this. I have searched <b>so very many</b> sites, only to find
      most of them blocked by IBOSS. The bane of my existence. <br /><br />
      This school has a very <b>VERY</b> strict internet policy and blocking
      system. They have even blocked educational sites and government run sites,
      such as Archive.org and the like. Although, with such a strict policy on
      the internet, us students barely manage to live on. We have to squeeze out
      as much fun as we humanly can out of games such as google snake,
      solitaire, scratch, and the like. <br />

    <a id="why_we_do_this"></a>
    <p class="header2">
      These games are fun, but get very repetitive and limited.
      <br />So, as said earlier, i have compiled a list of numerous fun games to
      play while you are bored.
